MGO-OOO-Bugs: A Benchmark of Multi-Granularity Out-of-Order Concurrency Bugs﻿

This repository contains the dataset for our paper on "Out-of-Order (OOO) Execution Bugs" under Weak Memory Models (WMM). We propose a Multi-Granularity Ordering (MGO) taxonomy and collect 58 OOO bug samples across different system abstraction layers.

📂 Repository Structure (MGO Taxonomy)
Our dataset is strictly categorized into three layers based on the triggering level of the concurrency bugs:
* **[Layer1](./Layer1)**: Micro-Instruction Level (22 Samples). Focuses on pure hardware-sensitive reorderings (Store-Store, Store-Load) in fundamental lock-free data structures (e.g., Spinlocks, Ring Buffers).
* **[Layer2](./Layer2)**: Resource Lifecycle Level (27 Samples). Focuses on hardware-agnostic and OS-level reorderings, typically manifesting as Use-After-Free (UAF) or Kernel Panics driven by thread scheduling or interrupts (e.g., Linux Kernel, Drivers).
* **[Layer3](./Layer3)**: Semantic Logic Level (9 Samples). Focuses on complex state machine or protocol disruptions in high-performance distributed systems and networking frameworks (e.g., MySQL, DPDK, sofa-pbrpc).
